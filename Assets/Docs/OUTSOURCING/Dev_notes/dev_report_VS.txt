üéØ Task: Replace Player Placeholder with Animated Character

ID: BLK-00.04B ‚Äî Player Sprite Update

Status: Completed 

- The Player is no longer a red square.
- The Player is now represented by a character sprite with walk animation.
- Movement uses the existing point-and-click navigation system (BLK-00.04).

Tests performed to ensure correct behavior:
- Character replaces red square in Play mode.
- Navigation remains functional (click to move).
- No console errors or broken references.
- Code committed to the dedicated branch

üêõ BUG-ELV-001 ‚Äî Elevator Panel Visibility, Floor Highlight & Navigation Lock

Status: Fixed 

- Persistent visibility: once in the elevator zone, the floor buttons remain visible as long as the player stays inside.
- Continuous interaction: the player can press multiple buttons in sequence (e.g., 0‚Üí+1‚Üí0‚Üí‚Äì1) without leaving/re-entering.
- When pressing a button, it enters an ‚Äúactive/destination‚Äù state.
  On arrival, the destination button turns red (current floor), while the others revert to grey.
- Unblocked navigation: even when the elevator UI is visible, the player can still click outside the elevator and move freely on the map.

Tests performed to ensure correct behavior:
- Clicking outside the elevator UI always moves the player as normal.
- No new console errors or warnings introduced.

üêõ BUG-POT-002 ‚Äî Action Buttons State & Daily Availability

Status: Fixed 

Current behavior:

Day 1:
Active: Plant, Water.
Inactive: Light (no plant to illuminate yet).
Once Plant or Water is used ‚Üí button turns inactive immediately.

Day 2:
Inactive: Plant (already planted).
Active: Water, Light.
Once pressed, each turns inactive until the next day.
Buttons should reset daily at the start of each new day.

Tests performed to ensure correct behavior:
- Action buttons correctly reflect daily availability.
- Used actions immediately deactivate and cannot be clicked again until the next day.
- The Light button only becomes available when there‚Äôs actually a plant present.
- No console errors when buttons change state.

Notes for future improvement: 

Problem: The state of the buttons still doesn‚Äôt update correctly when moving to the next day, until the player closes and reopens the menu.
Proposed Fix: The button state should be refreshed when transitioning to the next day.
