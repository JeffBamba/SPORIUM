Bug001 ‚Äî Microscope retry cost not applied correctly

Description: When using the Microscope (STR-001) minigame, the retry cost logic is incorrect. Currently, pressing ‚ÄúStart Again‚Äù after a failed attempt does not consume any resource.

Expected Behavior:

First attempt of the day: consumes 1 Action (no CRY cost) as per the updated Economy.

Subsequent retries after a failure (within the same day): each retry must cost 2 CRY in addition to 1 Action.

Resource deductions must always apply consistently on every use.

Bug002 ‚Äî Lab minigame box position

Description: The Laboratory is placed to the right of the elevator (Level ‚Äì1). Currently, the Lab Minigame box is not aligned with the designated Lab area; the elevator shaft at Level 0 incorrectly leads only to the Dome.

Expected Behavior:

Exiting the elevator left leads to the Dome.

Exiting the elevator right leads to the Laboratory.

The Lab Minigame placeholder (Microscope UI box) must be positioned inside the proper Lab area as defined in Vault Map_01„Äê40:Blocking_01_Fase3_FINAL„Äë.

Bug003 ‚Äî Level ‚Äì2 missing message

Description: When trying to access Level ‚Äì2 via the elevator, nothing happens.

Expected Behavior: If the player attempts to go to Level ‚Äì2 before it is unlocked (requires MQ10 + parts), a text popup must appear with the message:
‚ÄúSorry, out of order‚Äù„Äê40:Blocking_01_Fase3_FINAL„Äë.

Bug004 ‚Äî Water button active without RAW WATER

Description: The WATER action button remains clickable even when the player has no WAT-RAW available. The action doesn‚Äôt execute (console logs an alert).

Expected Behavior: The WATER button should be disabled (unclickable) whenever WAT-RAW = 0 in the Inventory.

Bug005 ‚Äî Fruit production rate incorrect

Description: After the first Fruit is harvested from a Mature Plant, the plant currently generates +2 Fruits every day.

Expected Behavior: According to the Plant Growth Cycle, after maturity a plant should produce 1 Fruit every 2 days (collectible on the 3rd day).

Bug006 ‚Äî Inventory HUD toggle not working

Description: When pressing the Inventory button, the Inventory HUD opens but does not close. Additionally, the Inventory HUD sometimes appears partially off-camera.

Expected Behavior:

Pressing the Inventory button toggles the HUD (open/close).

The Inventory HUD must remain within camera bounds (no off-screen clipping).

Bug007 ‚Äî Inventory counter not updating after item use

Description: If the Inventory HUD is open and the player uses an item (e.g., WAT-RAW), the item counter does not update until the HUD is closed and reopened.

Expected Behavior: Item counters in the Inventory HUD should update immediately after each use.

Bug008 ‚Äî Fruit produced on same day of maturity

Description: When a plant reaches Mature (M) stage, it produces a Fruit immediately on the same day.

Expected Behavior: As per the Plant Growth System, plants should only produce the first Fruit on the following day after reaching maturity, not instantly.

Bug009 ‚Äî Missing feedback when collecting resources

Description: When collecting a Fruit or WAT-RAW, no feedback is displayed (only console log).

Expected Behavior: A text notification must appear on screen, e.g.:

‚ÄúYou collected Rainwater!‚Äù

‚ÄúNew Fruit added to Inventory!‚Äù.

Bug010 ‚Äî Elevator acceleration spike from ‚Äì2 to +1

Description: When moving the elevator from Level ‚Äì2 to Level +1, the elevator suddenly accelerates, creating an unnatural movement. This may be caused by the camera movement being added on top of the elevator animation.

Expected Behavior: The elevator transition between floors should be smooth and consistent, without sudden speed-ups. Camera movement and elevator motion should be synchronized to avoid a ‚Äújerky‚Äù effect.

Bug011 ‚Äî Elevator shaft and door placeholder missing

Description: The elevator shaft and elevator door currently have no proper placeholder in the scene.

Expected Behavior: A placeholder for the elevator shaft and elevator door should be implemented by grabbing the assets directly from the provided PSD image (VaultMap_01 reference„Äê40:Blocking_01_Fase3_FINAL„Äë). These placeholders will ensure correct alignment and prepare for final art integration.
