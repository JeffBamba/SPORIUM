🐛 Bug Briefing — Pot Growth System
Task ID

BLK-01.04 — Pot Growth Visualization & Points Counter Issues

🔁 Repro Steps

Launch the game in Unity and open scene SCN_VaultMap.

Select POT-001 and plant a seed (Stage = Seed).

Advance days using EndDay while applying Water and/or Light actions.

Observe both the plant’s visual placeholder and the growth points counter.

⚠️ Observed Behavior

Bug #1 (Visual Placeholder):
POT-001 does not update its placeholder image when the plant stage changes. It always shows the Seed sprite, even after the plant should be at Sprout or Mature.

Bug #2 (Growth Points Counter):
When performing Water or Light actions, the growth points counter does not update. The HUD continues to show the initial value instead of incrementing.

🎯 Expected Behavior

Bug #1: Whenever the plant stage changes (Seed → Sprout → Mature), the placeholder image should also update in the scene and HUD accordingly.

Bug #2: After each valid action (Water, Light), growth points should increment based on the rules in PlantGrowthConfig, and the HUD should immediately reflect the updated value.

📦 Deliverables

Fix in PotGrowthController to correctly switch placeholder sprites when advancing stages.

Fix in PotStateModel (or related systems) to ensure growth points increment on actions and trigger OnPotStateChanged.

HUD integration: ensure that updated stage and growth points are displayed consistently.

Add debug logs for verification:

[PotGrowth] POT-001 advanced to Stage 2 (Sprout)

[PotGrowth] POT-001 GrowthPoints = X.

✅ Definition of Done

Visual placeholder updates correctly at each stage transition.

Growth points increment correctly after actions and HUD updates in real time.

Console shows clear debug logs for stage changes and point updates.

No errors or warnings in Unity Console.
