DEV REPORT 

Bug001 — Microscope retry cost

Fix: 
Implemented correct retry cost logic. 
First daily attempt now consumes only 1 Action, while subsequent retries deduct 2 CRY + 1 Action consistently.

Bug002 — Lab minigame box position

Fix:
Adjusted the Lab Minigame UI placeholder. Elevator exits are now mapped correctly: left → Dome, right → Laboratory. 

Bug003 — Level –2 missing message

Fix: 
Added proper popup message trigger. Attempting to access Level –2 before unlock now displays: “Sorry, out of order.”

Bug004 — Water button active without RAW WATER

Fix: 
If WAT-RAW = 0, the button is disabled and unclickable.

Bug005 — Fruit production rate incorrect

Fix:
Corrected growth cycle logic. Mature plants now produce 1 Fruit every 2 days

Bug006 — Inventory HUD toggle not working

Fix: 
Implemented toggle functionality

Bug007 — Inventory counter not updating after item use

Fix:
Added live update for item counters. Inventory HUD reflects resource changes immediately after usage

Bug008 — Fruit produced on same day of maturity

Fix:
Adjusted production timing. First Fruit now spawns the day after the plant reaches maturity, not on the same day.

Bug009 — Missing feedback when collecting resources

Fix:
Added on-screen notifications for resource collection, e.g. “You collected Rainwater!” / “New Fruit added to Inventory!”

Bug010 — Elevator acceleration spike (–2 to +1)

Fix:
Synced elevator and camera motion.

Bug011 — Elevator shaft and door placeholder missing

Fix:
Implemented proper placeholders using assets from VaultMap_01 PSD.

Bug012 — Day counter mismatch between HUD and Pot details

Fix:
Unified day-tracking logic across HUD and Pot detail views.
