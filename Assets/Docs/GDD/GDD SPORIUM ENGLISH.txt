Version: GDD17 (Latest Extended)

üéØ Vision

Sporium is a management/simulation game in pixel art, set in a post-apocalyptic future.

Player role: A solitary biologist living and working inside an underground botanical Vault, tasked with reconstructing‚Äîor corrupting‚Äîthe remnants of biodiversity through spores, seeds, cloning, and genetic manipulation.

Game rhythm: Daily cycles, missions, faction reputation, emergent narrative progression.

Atmosphere: Dark, suspended between science and madness, with semi-realistic pixel art aesthetics, neon lights, and bioluminescent elements.

Player goal: Rebuild ecological balance or push the Vault into corruption, in a contemplative, ethical, and replayable experience.

Key features:

No global timer ‚Üí freedom of choice and pace

Consequences accumulate across runs

Blend of strategy, management, and narrative

üåå Lore & Main Quest

Origin of the Vault: The last surviving botanical laboratory, inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, surviving after a global collapse (climate crisis, fungal pandemic, biotechnological wars).

The Biologist: An ambiguous protagonist‚Äîcould be a survivor, a clone, or a dying dream.

The Sporium Journal:

Serves as narrative log and inner voice

Tone: poetic, unstable, contradictory, glitch-like

Generates micro-missions tied to player achievements

Factions
Code	Faction	Vision	Tone	Example Missions
CR	Keepers of Renewal	Ecological reconstruction, hope	Fragile idealism	Plant pure seed, cleanse mold, deliver healing fruits
CM	Mold Cult	Worship of mold, corruption	Degenerate ecstasy	Cultivate corrupted spores, offer fungal relics, spread infestation
MO	Shadow Merchants	Seed smuggling, trade	Dark pragmatism	Smuggle hybrids, barter for CRY, deliver mutated plants
IP	Hypnotics	Spore-induced trance, visions	Disturbing surrealism	Donate dream spores, grow hallucinogenic flora
MIL	Military	Order, control, exploitation	Harsh dominance	Supply resistant fibers, deliver toxic plants as weapons
REL	Cultists	Faith, ritual, superstition	Tragic/absurd	Sacrificial offerings, ritual planting on specific dates
Main Questline

Symbolic conflict between Keepers of Renewal and Mold Cult.

Branching outcomes: restoration, corruption, or ambiguous ‚Äúeternal loop‚Äù revelation (the Vault as a deathbed dream).

‚öôÔ∏è Core Gameplay
Plant Growth Cycle

Flow: Spores ‚Üí Seeds ‚Üí Plant ‚Üí Hybrid/Mutation

Each plant grows through 3 stages (Seedling ‚Üí Growing ‚Üí Mature)

Average duration: ~5 days per plant (e.g., PLT-101: 2+3 days, total 5)

Care actions: watering, pruning, LED exposure, antifungal sprays, leaf analysis

Growth is deterministic and time-based, with state persistence between sessions

Resource Management

Currencies:

CRY ‚Üí surviving cryptocurrency, used for energy and trades

BRR ‚Üí direct barter currency

Daily Action Points (AP): 4 per day

Plant: ‚Äì50 CRY, ‚Äì1 AP

Water: ‚Äì30 CRY, ‚Äì1 AP

Light: ‚Äì40 CRY, ‚Äì1 AP

End Day: ‚Äì20 CRY

Ecological System (Dome pH)

Scale: ‚Äì100 (Ultra Acidic) ‚Üî +100 (Ultra Basic)

Pure plants increase alkalinity

Corrupted plants increase acidity

Monocultures push to extremes

Rare hybrids help stabilize balance

pH Ranges & Effects:

Range	State	Effects
‚Äì100/‚Äì80	Ultra Acidic	Pure plants collapse; toxic +50% yield
‚Äì79/‚Äì30	Stable Acidic	Toxic plants thrive; +10% mutations
‚Äì29/+29	Neutral	Biodiversity stable
+30/+79	Stable Basic	Pure plants thrive
+80/+100	Ultra Basic	Toxic collapse; pure hyper-productive but sterile
