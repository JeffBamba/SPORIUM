# 🌱 SPORIUM — Game Design Document

**Version: GDD19**
**Date: 06/09/2025**

---

## 🎯 Vision

**Sporium** is a pixel art management/simulation game set in a post-apocalyptic future.

The player takes the role of a lonely biologist who lives and works in an underground botanical Vault, aiming to **rebuild or corrupt biodiversity** through spores, seeds, cloning, and genetic manipulation.

* **Pacing**: daily cycles, missions, faction reputation, emergent narrative progression.
* **Atmosphere**: dark, suspended between science and madness, with semi-realistic/pixel art aesthetics illuminated by LEDs and bioluminescence.
* **Player Goal**: achieve ecological balance, or push the Vault towards corruption, in a contemplative, ethical, and replayable experience.
* **Key Feature**: no global timer, freedom of choice, but long-term consequences.

---

## 🌌 Lore & Main Quest

### Origin of the Vault

The last surviving botanical laboratory, inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. It endured a global collapse (climate, fungal pandemic, biotech war).

### The Biologist

An ambiguous identity (survivor, clone, or deathbed delirium).

### SPORIUM Diary

Narrative log, unstable inner voice, contradictory, poetic, glitchy.

### Factions

| Faction               | Vision                             | Tone                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Custodians of Renewal | Ecological reconstruction and hope | Fragile idealism      |
| Cult of the Mold      | Corruption, mold as joy            | Degenerate ecstasy    |
| Shadow Merchants      | Seed smuggling, cynicism           | Dark pragmatism       |
| Hypnotics             | Dreamlike trance induced by spores | Disturbing visions    |
| Military              | Order and exploitation             | Harshness, domination |
| Religious Sect        | Devotion and superstition          | Tragic/ridiculous     |

### Main Quest

Symbolic conflict Custodians ↔ Mold Cult, with variable outcomes. Possible eternal loop ending → the entire game is the biologist’s deathbed dream.

---

## ⚙️ Core Gameplay

* **Cultivation**: from spores → seeds → plants → hybrids/mutations.
* **Pipeline**: Cloning → Seed Manipulation → Hybridization → Mutations.
* **Routine**: watering, pruning, LED exposure, antifungal sprays, leaf analysis.
* **Reputation**: affects trades, mission access, black market.
* **Events**: random arrivals, sabotage, mold infestations, blackouts, bartering.
* **SPORIUM Diary**: poetic and glitchy micro-missions.

---

## 🏛️ Main Environments & Vault Map\_01

* **Exterior**: Visitor Room + Seed Storage connected via pneumatic tube to elevator.
* **Level –1**: Central Dome + Laboratory.
* **Level –2**: Food Dome + Biologist’s Bedroom.
* **Level –3**: “?” (secret/future expansion area).

**Navigation**: vertical with elevator (–5 CRY) or free stairs.

---

## 📖 SPORIUM Diary

* **Function**: log + narrative voice.
* **Tone**: poetic, delirious, contradictory.
* **Functions**:

  * Generates micro-missions tied to achievements.
  * Visual/audio glitches as fourth-wall breaks.
  * Influences the player’s perception of story truth.

---

## 🔬 Key Systems

### Spores (SPO-xxx)

* **SPO-001 Pure** → stability, regenerative traits.
* **SPO-002 Corrupted** → instability, toxicity.
* **SPO-003 Neutral** → unpredictability.
* **SPO-004 Oneiric** → occultism, visions.

### Hybridization

Combining two species → seeds with fixed traits.
Codes: HYB-201…210.

### Seed Manipulation

Post-cloning step → allows unique traits and variations.

### Reputation

Scale –100 ↔ +100. Affects missions, trade access, events.

### Events & Visitors

Random arrivals bringing crises, requests, gifts, sabotage.
Codes EVT-001…010.
